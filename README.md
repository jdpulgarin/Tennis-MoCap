A tennis action dataset:  competitive performance of Caldas-Colombia tennis players
 
The MoCap data were collected from 17 players: five labeled as high performance (HP) and 12 more as regular (RP). The employed motion capture protocol was Biovision Hierarchy (BVH), stipulating the placement of 34 markers defined by Arena software. Optitrack Flex V100 (100 Hz) infrared videography was acquired at sagittal, frontal, and lateral planes. All subjects were encouraged to hit the ball as they would in a match. They were instructed to hit one series of the same tennis stroke per 30 seconds. The process was repeated with all six tennis gestures.

The data process, trajectoring, and skeletonization of each player were executed in Arena too. The exported BVH file has the trajectories and a skeleton with 23 3D-points of interest (body joints and terminal points).
